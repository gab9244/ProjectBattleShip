Battleship Project

This project was one of the projects of The Odin Project course, and it was one of the hardest problems of the course. In my opinion, it was the final project of the course.

Purpose

My goal with this project was to put all the knowledge I had on display.
My plain was to use draggable divs as the ships but i couldn't find a way to make the ships not overlap each other.
The greatest challenge was how to make so none of the ships go to other lines. I'm not gonna lie that was hard and took me sometime but, i find a solution for both of the problems, unfortunately by the time i find a solution i've alright give up of using drag and drop and start to use hover.

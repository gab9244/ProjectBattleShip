Battleship Project

This project was one of the projects of The Odin Project course, and it was one of the hardest problems of the course. In my opinion, it was the final project of the course.

Purpose

My goal with this project was to put all the knowledge I had on display. My plan was to use draggable divs as the ships, but I couldn't find a way to make the ships not overlap each other. The greatest challenge was how to make sure none of the ships went to other lines. I'm not gonna lie, that was hard and took me some time, but I find a solution for both of the problems. Unfortunately,Â  by the time I found a solution, I'd already given up using drag and drop and started using hover. The solution in question was to create a variable that had the current position of the ship plus its length minus 1 and use it to know if the first block of every line has it; if it does, the ship would disappear and it would not be possible to place it.

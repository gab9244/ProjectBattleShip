Battleship Project

This project was one of the projects of The Odin Project course, and it was one of the hardest problems of the course. In my opinion, it was the final project of the course.

Purpose

My goal with this project was to put all the knowledge I had on display.
My plain was to use draggable divs as the ships but i couldn't find a way to make the ships not overlap each other and that was the greatest challenge of this project
